            Common Name: Common Bald Cypress 
            Scientific Name: Taxodium distichum</name>
                <description>
            Tree Type: Deciduous
            
            Origin: South Eastern North America
            
            About: The baldcypress tree is the classic tree of southern swamps. There, in its native habitat, it displays a peculiar habit of raising conical "knees" from its roots. The function of these growths is something of a mystery, although some believe it is a way to help the roots get oxygen. This tree dwells in swamps because it out-competes most other trees on such sites. To the surprise of many, the baldcypress does quite well when planted in the right soil in yards or along streets and is a beautiful specimen tree. It has been grown successfully in cities as far north as Milwaukee and on dry Texas hills.</description>

            About: John Bartram was appointed Royal Botanist for North America by King George III in 1765. In that same year, John Bartram and his son William discovered franklinia growing in a 2-3 acre tract along the banks of the Altamaha River in southeastern Georgia. Franklinia has never been observed growing in any other place than along the Altamaha River. In a return trip in 1773, William Bartram collected seed from this site and brought it back to the Bartram's garden in Philadelphia where the tree was successfully grown. This tree has been extinct in the wild since 1803.</description>

            About: Japanese Umbrella Pine is named for its elegant shape and cascading green needles. It usually grows to 25' and is a slow grower. Japanese umbrella trees (Sciadopitys verticillata) are small, strikingly beautiful trees that never fail to draw attention. Called “koya-maki” in Japan, the tree is one of Japan’s five sacred trees. These richly textured conifers are rare and expensive in nurseries because they grow slowly and it takes a long time to grow a sapling large enough to sell. In the landscape, it can take 100 years for a sapling to reach mature size.</description>

            Tree Type: Coniferous
            
            Origin: Northern Africa
            
            About: This highly coveted tree is truly one-of-a-kind. The Blue Atlas Cedar can be found in its natural habit in the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa. The tree’s silvery blue to bluish-green needles, about 1 1/2” long, can be stiff and clustered. Once it’s started to hit its stride, the Blue Atlas produces barrel-shaped male cones that are about 2-3” long on the lower branches; browning, from green, over a period of two years. Like with any needled evergreen it will shed from time to time, but this occurence is knothing to worry about.</description>
