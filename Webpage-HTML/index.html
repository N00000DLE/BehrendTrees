                <h1>Our Goal</h1>
                <p>Our Inspiration for the project was the nature that surrounds Penn State
                    Behrend.We want to try to encompass the natural beauty that Penn State's
                    Arboretum and trees have to offer. The Arboretum not only captures unique tree
                    species from around the world, it can be used to follow the history of Behrend.
