        <desc>The Scarlet Oak is a large tree with rounded, open crown, and an autumn color. carlet
            oak is a 75 ft., deciduous tree, occasionally reaching heights of 150 ft. A somewhat
            pyramidal crown develops from stout, ascending branches. Bark brown with fine fissures
            and scaly ridges, inner bark is red to orangish-pink. Twigs are smooth reddish-brown;
            clustered terminal buds are ovoid and reddish-brown with pubescence near the apex,
            5-angled in cross section. Leaves smooth petiole 3/4 - 2 3/8 inches (19 - 60 mm) in
            length; leaves are elliptic to obovate, 2 3/4 - 6 1/4 inches (70 - 159 mm) long, 3 - 5
            1/8 inches (76 - 130 mm) wide, margins with 5 - 9 lobes extending more than 1/2 the
            distance to the midrib, base truncate, apex acute; upper surface a glossy light green,
            with tufts of axillary tomentum beneath, secondary veins raised on both surfaces. Leaves
            turn rich, scarlet-red in the fall. Catkins appear just before or with the appearance of
            new leaves. A popular and handsome shade and street tree. The lumber is marketed as Red
            Oak, which differs in its shallowly lobed, dull green leaves, and acorns with a shallow
            cup. Black Oak (Quercus velutina) is also similar, but has yellow-green leaves with
            brown hairs beneath and acorns with a deep cup of loose hairy scales. This species is
            very susceptible to fire damage because of its thin bark. Such injuries often result in
            heart rot. Grows rapidly and begins to bear fruit at age 20.</desc>

        <desc>The Flowering Dogwood is a single or multi-trunked tree with a spreading crown and
            long lasting, white and pink spring blooms. It is a small flowering tree with a short
            trunk and drown of spreading or horizontal branches. The tree hosts red fruits and other
            scarlet red fall foliage. The Flowering Dogwood is known as one of the most beautiful
            North American trees with beautiful early spring flowers and red fruit. Its hard wood is
            extremely shock-resistant and useful for making woven items. It is also made into
            spools, small pulleys, mallet heads, and jeweler's blocks. Indians used the aromatic
            bark and roots as a remedy for malaria and extracted a red dye from the roots. </desc>

        <desc>The baldcypress tree is the classic tree of southern swamps. There, in its native
            habitat, it displays a peculiar habit of raising conical "knees" from its roots. The
            function of these growths is something of a mystery, although some believe it is a way
            to help the roots get oxygen. This tree dwells in swamps because it out-competes most
            other trees on such sites. To the surprise of many, the baldcypress does quite well when
            planted in the right soil in yards or along streets and is a beautiful specimen tree. It
            has been grown successfully in cities as far north as Milwaukee and on dry Texas hills. </desc>

            approximately 40-60 feet in height. They are tolerant of many different growing
            environments and have been a popular tree to plant on lawns and along streets because of
            their hardiness. Norway maples have very shallow roots and produce a great deal of shade
            which makes it difficult for grass and other plants to grow in the understory below.
