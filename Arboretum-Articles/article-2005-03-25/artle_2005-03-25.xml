        <p>Few students realize the amount of land Behrend claims as its own or the num ber of
            species of trees on campus or even that Behrend is now a recognized arbore tum. Even
            less is the number of students aware of what an arboretum is exactly. It was not until
            recently, April 23, 2003, that the college was recognized for its extensive collection
            of greenery.</p>
        <p>Behrend officially carries the title of an arboretum. An arboretum typically refers to a
            place where an extensive variety of woody plants are cultivated for scientific,
            educational and ornamental purposes.</p>
        <p>With 725 total acres, Behrend is home to more than 175 different categories of trees.
            Part of this can be attributed to the significant contribution of land to the col lege
            from <person>Mary Behrend</person>.</p>
        <p>"I knew there were a lot of trees," said <person>Ruth Hoetzl</person>, BIOL 06. "I just
            never real ized that we had so many different kinds of trees on campus; without them we
            would die!"</p>
        <p>The fact that Behrend is now considered an arboretum can be attributed to one professor
            emeritus of biology, <person>Dr. Edwin Masteller</person>. <person>Masteller</person>
            worked for many years so that Behrend would become a place to admire and learn about
            different plant life. After the dedication, faculty of the <org>Biology Department</org>
            gathered to create a website that would guide students and the public to learning about
            the trees on campus</p>
        <p>The website, which can be accessed at http://bio.bd.psu.edu/plant_web/, includes a
            Virtual Tree Tour, labeled plants arranged in alphabetical order of com mon names (also
            with thumbnail image preview), a list of the trees organized by plant family and a
            collection of plant photographs from all over campus.</p>
        <p>The tour is a replication of a campus map with numbers indicating where certain tree
            species can be located around the university. The numbers on the map are each linked to
            their own web page about that particular tree.</p>
        <p>Each tree's web page includes photographs of the whole tree, the leaves, flow ers (if
            existing) and the little black identification signs (again, if existing), as well as a
            description of the tree and links to obtain more information.</p>
        <p>This website is far from complete, however, as there are currently 67 trees pre sented on
            the virtual tour and over 175 varieties of tree on campus. Nonetheless, additions to the
            website will continue as Behrend's Arboretum con tinues to grow.</p>
        <p>Plans for the future include an herbarium or a collection of dried plants mount ed,
            labeled and systematically arranged for use in scientific study that will enhance
            education, outreach, research and conservation efforts on university property. </p>
