        <header><title>Aboretum beautifies Behrend</title> By <author>Bryan Spry</author> staff
            writer</header>
        <p>On Tuesday Penn State Erie will be holding a ceremony celebrating its one-year anniver
            sary of becoming an official arboretum. Al though Penn State Behrend was not designated
            as an official Arboretum until 2003, the arbo retum at Behrend began to form over five
            de cades ago and continues to develop.</p>
        <p>Over five decades ago, <person>Ernst</person> and <person>Mary</person> Behrend began to
            collect trees from exotic re gions where they would vacation. The Behrends would then
            plant these exotic trees on their Glenhill estate property. In 1948, <person>Mary
                Behrend</person> donated her estate with the in tention of building an educational
            institution that would be preserved in the natural beauty of the environment.</p>
        <p>An arboretum is defined as a place where an extensive variety of woody plants are culti
            vated for scientific, educational and ornamen tal purposes. This is the intent of
            faculty and students that continue to develop the arbbre tum at Penn State Behrend.</p>
        <p>Behrend’s arboretum covers a massive seven hundred and twenty-five acres. This arbore tum
            contains over two hundred different spe cies of trees, making Behrend the largest col
            lege or university arboretum in the region. In this broad variety of species, all of the
            fifty state trees are included Pennsylvania’s being the eastern hemlock, or to those
            scientists, the Tsuga Canadensis.</p>
        <p>The Penn State Behrend Arboretum has three main aspects. The first is the educational ap
            proach to the arboretum. The arboretum serves not only the student body and faculty, but
            the community as well. It acts as an educational tool on how to help preserve the
            environment. Second is the experimental aspect of the ar boretum. It serves the students
            of Behrend with the ability to experiment and test the uses, if any, of the trees and
            shrubs native and ex otic to our region.</p>
        <p><person>Dr. Thomas I</person>. <person>Wortman</person>, the assistant for aca demic
            administration and executive director of the arboretum at Penn State Behrend, said, “We
            would obviously like to grow,” Wortman said. “We would like to host schools as well as
            dif ferent groups from around the region. We would like to educate them on the different
            variety of species of trees and allow them to enjoy the beauty that the arboretum at
            Behrend has to offer. We have a partnership with the <org>Lake Erie Arboretum</org> at
                <org>Frontier Park</org> and are actually connected to them by the walkway that goes
            along the bayfront connector.”</p>
        <p><person>Wortman</person> said, “We would like to concen trate more on the educational and
            research as pects that the arboretum gives.”</p>
        <p>Students from Behrend also appreciate this intriguing landscape. Freshman <person>Ben
                Morris </person>said, “The arboretum at Behrend makes the campus more scenic. I also
            think other stu dents enjoy it as well. I see people sitting along the walkways drawing
            pictures of the scenery this campus has to offer.”</p>
        <p><person>Brian Misterovich</person>, INT B 07, said, “The ar- boretum creates a more
            interesting landscape and exposes the student body to a greater awareness to the dynamic
            tree species.” If you are interested in celebrating this achievement, there will be a
            tree planting cer emony to commemorate this one year anniver sary of the arboretum. It
            will be held Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. on the walkway just north of the Lilley Library.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in seeing this amazing arboretum for yourself, pick up a pamphlet
            at the information desk in the Reed Union Build ing. The pamphlet includes a brief
            history of the arboretum and a numbered map of tree names and where these trees are
            located on campus. You will be able to see over 70 dif ferent species of trees along
            with a sign below them which gives you their scientific name and any other interesting
            facts relevant to that par ticular tree.</p>
