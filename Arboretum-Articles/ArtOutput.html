         <div class="artAuthor">Author: Erin McCarty</div>
         
         <div class="paras">On Monday, Bruno's unveiled the Ecomug, a reusable mug emblazoned with a reminder
            to
            reduce, reuse, and recycle. Students can buy the mug, full of coffee or pop, for a
            dollar and refill it for 80 cents. It comes with a hook allowing it to be attached
            to
            bookbags, making it easy to transport.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Bruno's disposes an estimated 10,000 cups a week, so the mugs have the potential to
            greatly reduce waste on campus. Nonetheless, it was one of the smaller projects
            undertaken by the Greener Behrend Task Force, which focuses on campus
            sustainability issues.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"It's the message that's so important," said Dr. Thomas Wortman, chair
            of the task force. "A project like this will create some commitment."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Wortman is also pleased that the project was a collaborative effort
            between the task force and Housing and Food Services. Students in
            Jeanette Schnars' environmental science class conceived the idea. The cups were designed
            specifically for Behrend, but they are expected to spread throughout the rest of the
            Penn State system.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Since it formed last year, the task force has developed more than 20 projects
            designed for Behrend's ecological benefit. Right now, it is focusing on two major
            projects. First, it is writing a grant with Erie County Recycling to get
            money for a composting machine. This machine would be the first of its kind in Erie
            County, and the resulting compost would be used as fertilizer in various areas around
            campus.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Second, it is working to inventory what trees are on campus; decide where trees should
            be
            planted; re-beautify the entrance area; develop a map of trees on campus; and have
            Behrend declared an arboretum. At least one specimen of each of the 50 state trees
            resides at Behrend.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"There is a major push for all things trees." said Wortman. "This is
            exactly the time for us to celebrate the arboreal heritage of the campus."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">As the task force tackles major issues, students can display their ecological
            awareness in a variety of simple ways. For instance, they can take advantage of the
            new
            printing system in Behrend's computer centers that prints on both sides of the paper
            and
            make efforts not to print unnecessary items.</div>
         
         <div class="paras"> The task force identifies seven major sections within the sustainahility
            issue: reducing energy use: conserving water: minimizing waste: increasing the
            healthfulness of food and reducing its waste; protecting and preserving natural areas;
            using environmentally friendly practices; and promoting ecological stewardship within
            the community.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"It's important to do the little things. - said Wortman. "Anything we do
            locally has a direct impact on everything_ outside hcie It's not wally about a greener
            Behrend: it ., about a greener everything."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Wortman went on to say that we, the beneficiaries of the Behrend
            family's generosity, have an obligation to the gift they gave us. He feels that they
            would he proud of the steps that are being taken to preserve the natural beauty of
            the
            campus.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"Ecology is not a political issue," said Wortman. "It's for everybody."
            The task force is seeking more participants, especially students. For more

         <div class="artAuthor">Author: Jen Henderson</div>
         
         
         <div class="paras">The Greener Behrend Task Force has
            great ideas on keeping the campus
            environmentally preserved. This group
            of people, alongwith many others, has
            helped to further develop Behrend
            environmentally. These changes have
            led the campus to be offered
            membership in the American
            Association of Botanical Gardens and
            Arboreta.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The campus is now known as an
            arboretum and will be fully inducted in
            a ceremony that will take place on April
            23</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Throughout the campus's 725 acres
            there are a variety of diverse trees in
            remote locations and in various buildings. The Behrend campus has at least
            one of each of the 50 states' trees.
            Pennsylvania's tree, the eastern hemlock, are located all over, including the
            other side of the Studio Theatre. The
            state tree ofHawaii is located inside the
            Kochel Building, in an attempt to keep
            it alive and healthy</div>
         
         <div class="paras">While most trees are located throughout our campus, some are inside, and
            others grow in the green house which
            is located behind the Otto Behrend
            building.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Dr. Thomas Wortman, special
            projects assistant to the provost and
            dean, along with Dr. Robert Light, associate provost and dean, lead the task
            force at Behrend. Wortman is very
            proud of what has been done with the
            surroundings thus far and believes the
            original owners would be too.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">He is especially proud of "how we
            maintain the beauty and integrity of
            this setting and how we've acted responsibly towards the Behrends' gift
            to us. Frankly I think the Behrend
            family would be pretty proud of what
            we have done here, they would he
            happythat we are conserving the sort
            ofthings that they gave us fifty five
            years ago."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Sam Marvit is a freshman student who is 
            also actively involved with the task force.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"It gives students a chance to he involved simply with consen ation because it is
            a crisis today in America,
            mainly because we use most of the
            world's resources," said Mary it
            "Hopefully we can take one step at
            making it less of a crisis and working
            with nature as opposed towards working against nature, 
            which is most often happening."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Marvit has done this work before
            and believes that this is a wonderful
            chance for students to get invoked.
            "It's great for students because it also
            prepares them for what the world may be like in future 
            times once conservation grows more rapidly, as it is now.
            I've been involved with a lot of conservation groups, outdoor
            groups, environmentalist groups, and thought that this would 
            just be one more to help."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The Behrend campus being named an arboretum benefits 
            everyone involved.  "It gives us the opportunity to have an 
            organized effort toward using this natural environment here,
            specifically our trees and our other botanical resources."
            said Wortman. "It also is a reach out to the
            community so our students can then
            interact with the other people and the
            things around them."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Earth Day is April 22 and the task
            force along with student activities and
            organizations are working towards setting up a day of events to celebrate.
            There will be educational activities on
            sustainability issues and open stage
            performances. Area school children
            will be invited to take tours ofthe campus to see why it has been chosen to be
            called an arboretum. The final details
            for this event will be available within
            the next few weeks</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Last year, Eco-mugs were introduced
            and this year will be no exception.
            Housing and Food services will bring
            the mugs back, but redesigned to keep
            the idea fresh. This program seemed
            to be very successful last year.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">On April 23, a ceremony will be held
            inducting the Behrend campus as an arboretum. There are three arboretums in
            Erie County: the Erie Zoological Society and the Lake Erie Arboretum and
            Frontier Park, along with the Behrend
            campus. Behrend's arboretum is very
            large and spread out over heavily
            wooded areas in the gorge, managed areas, wild areas, such as on top ofthe
            ski hill, meadow, and grassland.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Three hundred various species have
            been identified thus far and experts are
            still performing research on this
            project. It can prove to be difficult due
            to the time and knowledge needed to
            work on this process. The group is also
            looking to make a pamphlet showing
            where the various trees are located
            throughout the campus.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Other members of the task force involved in these projects include: Dr.
            Edwin C. Masteller, R. Thomas Guth,
            landscape supervisor, Dr. Zachary
            Irwin, associate professor of political
            science, Dr. Paul Barney, lecturer in biology, Dr. Roger Knacke, director of
            the School of Science, Dr. Michael
            Campbell, associate professor of biology, along with Wortman and Light.
            Many of the original ideas for these
            projects originated from Masteller, who
            is now retired.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The Task Force is focusing on
            sustainability. This entails living
            within means and using the resources
            that Earth provides. The Task Force's
            seven main issues include: reducing energy use, conserving water, minimizing waste,
            increasing the healthiness of
            food and reducing its waste, protecting and preserving natural areas, using
            "green" practices, and promoting ecological stewardship within the community.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The mission of the arboretum is to
            conserve and promote the legacy ofthe
            campus' unique natural botanical resources through: advancement of related education,
            outreach, research, and
            conservation efforts; documentation
            and enhancement of the campus' botanical diversity; and the maintenance
            of the campus' inspirational woodland setting. Their vision
            is that it will be recognized as an important education, outreach
            research, and conservation resource.
            </div>
         
         <div class="paras">When asked if he is looking for others to aid in this project, Marvit said,
            "I've used publicity towards conservation, but I believe that we shouldn't try
            to recruit people, we aren't an army.
            At the same time people should want
            to work with us, we are only improving the area and where students live and
            study.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"We are trying to keep up with national
            standards of conservation and a lot of
            other universities are probably a lot better than we are, as good as it seems.
            But what we are doing isn't novel at
            all, it is like everyone else. It's in no
            way radical. It's just about conservation."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">In response Wortman said, "The
            ideas are hardly radical, it's very mainstream. It's about conservingthe beauty
            and the biodiversity, it's not about making political statements.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"Arboretum is certainly a work in
            progress, it's not somethingthat comes
            in a box and you open it up and then
            you have arboretum. Arboretum requires the efforts of a whole lot of
            people and it changes, sometimes day
            to day. It's a dynamic thing, rather than
            a static one."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Everyone
            on the Behrend campus should be
            proud of what the Greener Behrend
            Task Force has done for the campus.
            "If we believe so strongly in our trees
            to become an arboretum, then students
            are probably the most critical part of
            that," said Wortman.</div>

         <div class="artAuthor">Author: Katie Zellars</div> 
         
         <div class="paras">The Behrend campus will officially be dedicated as an arboretum, a place where
            trees are grown for scientific and educational purposes, and a member of the
            American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta. The ceremony will
            be on Wednesday at 10:15 a.m. in the Glenhill Circle. in conjunction with Earth Day
            activities.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"It formalizes and recognizes a lot of the good things we've done already," said
            Dr. Thomas Wortman, special projects assistant to the dean and head
            of the Greener Behrend Task Force. "It also gives us some pretty dramatic
            opportunities for education and research."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The campus prides itself that at least one state tree from every state is located
            on its 725 acres.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Dr. Jack Burke and the Greener Behrend Task Force will
            host the ceremony. Speakers will include Wortman; Dr. Zachary
            Irwin, associate professor of political science and Landscape
            Committee member; and Donna Mindek, Harborcreek Supervisor
            and member of the township's Bicentennial Committee.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Community members and Klein Elementary third graders, who will participate in
            activities before the ceremony, will attend the dedication. Refreshments will be served
            afterwards and tree guides will be given.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Students and professors think the campus becoming an arboretum is a great thing and
            agree that the campus is really a beautiful one. Sophomore Mindy Schwartz thinks that
            the arboretum will be great for education.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"It gives you a chance to learn about trees that are in your own backyard," said
            Schwartz.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"I think it's really good that we're doing it," said ecology professor Pamela
            Silver. "A lot of people have worked really long and hard to achieve that status."</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The goal of establishing the campus as a national arboretum has been going on for
            only a year but the college has been dedicated to preserving and expanding its natural
            library for years.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Even before Mary Behrend donated the original 400 acres to Penn
            State, the Behrends added East Asian and other exotic trees into the native
            landscape.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Wortman says at least 300 species and subspecies of trees are on
            campus. It would be nearly impossible to categorize all the different kinds of trees
            with all the hybrids that have developed but it is one of their goals, which will
            be
            included into class curriculum.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Other goals for the arboretum include research and grant funding. It will also
            highly involve the community.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"We are part of a group of education institutions around us and we live in a
            region, state, country, and a world that we cannot ignore," says
            Wortman. "An arboretum is part of that thinking."</div>

         <div class="paras">The Greener Behrend Task Force is fo cusing on educating students and
            the community about sustainability this year. Sustainability, according to a
            Greener Behrend Task Force pamphlet, is “about living within our means,
            working with the Earth and respect.” Dr. Thomas Wortman, assistant for
            academic admin istration heads the Task Force and Mary Beth Peterson,
            director of the Career Development Center, is also a committee member for the
            Greener Behrend Task Force.</div>
         
         <div class="paras"> “About three years ago the University asked us [Penn State Behrend] to include
            something into our planning process about ecological sustainability, instead.. .we
            decided to do.. .a major ef fort towards sustainability and that is [where] the
            Greener Behrend Task Force started,” said Wortman.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The Task Force has seven goals. One: to reduce energy use; two: conserve
            wa ter; three: minimize solid and liquid waste; four: increase the quality of food
            and
            reduce its waste; five: protect and preserve natural areas; six: use “green” practices
            into the construction and reno vation of facilities; and seven: promote ecological
            stewardship within the col lege community.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">According to Wortman, “We’re con centrating our energy this year
            on edu cation by what we call stewardship, which is getting the word out to the whole
            campus community about how important sustainability is.” Ms. Peterson
            is in charge of the edu cation goal. Peterson says that, this year, the
            Task Force is concentrating on educating why sustainability is in
            everyone’s best interest and why people should take part in it.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">So far, the education committee held an energy conservation workshop for
            faculty and staff about winterizing their homes. Peterson said that a
            good way of promoting conservation of energy use and minimizing waste on campus is
            to
            have people start in their homes. For the students whose homes are on campus, the
            committee wants to work with RA’s and through clubs and organizations to begin
            brainstorming about reducing en ergy usage on campus, recycling and conserving water
            (reporting leaks, tak ing shorter showers, etc.).</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The committee is planning some events for this year, but nothing
            specific has been finalized yet. They are, how ever, talking about using the “Stall
            Stories” flyers to help educate students and faculty about water conservation, and
            possibly about having a “Greener Behrend garage sale” at the end of the spring semester.
            The sale would be an alternative for students who want to throw out useless items
            at the
            end of the year - instead of just pitching them into the dumpsters, they can donate
            them
            to the sale. All the proceeds they would make would then be turned back into the efforts
            towards the Greener Behrend Educational Committee.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">“Our biggest struggle...is trying to fig ure out what is the balance between
            progress and preservation,” said Dr. Wortman. He says sustainability is
            im portant because “this College believes in Friday, December 3, 2004 maintaining
            the
            history of this property. This was a wonderful gift from the Behrend family and we
            have
            a responsi bility to maintain the integrity of this beautiful piece of natural
            space.”</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Last year, the Task Force concentrated their efforts on The Arboretum at
            Penn State Behrend, which is the largest uni versity arboretum in the region. Accord
            ing
            to a media publication by the Greener Behrend Task Force, “An arboretum is a
            collection of woody plants that are labeled, cataloged and mapped... Through the local
            contributions of local garden clubs and Dr. Edwin C. Masteller, the
            college has been able to add to the pre existing collection of the Behrends. These
            collections, the gorge areas and all of campus (totaling over 725 acres) is what is
            included in the Arboretum at Penn State Behrend...”</div>
         
         <div class="paras">“I think sustainability is a goal for everyone,” stated Dr.
            Wortman. The Task Force is encouraging student in volvement.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">“We would love some high energy stu dents who have real concerns for these sorts
            of topics to join our group and add to our energies,” says Peterson.
            Dr. Wortman said, “We have zero students directly involved with any
            of our committees right now, it has been a struggle to get students involved...but
            I’m
            certain there are students that would be willing to help out at least by giving us
            their
            opinions or by getting involved in some planning...”</div>

            the Career Development Center (x 6164) or by e-mail: mbpl@psu.edu.</div>

         <div class="artAuthor">Author: Bryan Spry</div>
         
         <div class="paras">On Tuesday Penn State Erie will be holding a ceremony celebrating its one-year anniver
            sary of becoming an official arboretum. Al though Penn State Behrend was not designated
            as an official Arboretum until 2003, the arbo retum at Behrend began to form over
            five
            de cades ago and continues to develop.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Over five decades ago, Ernst and Mary Behrend began to
            collect trees from exotic re gions where they would vacation. The Behrends would then
            plant these exotic trees on their Glenhill estate property. In 1948, Mary
            Behrend donated her estate with the in tention of building an educational
            institution that would be preserved in the natural beauty of the environment.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">An arboretum is defined as a place where an extensive variety of woody plants are
            culti
            vated for scientific, educational and ornamen tal purposes. This is the intent of
            faculty and students that continue to develop the arbbre tum at Penn State Behrend.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Behrend’s arboretum covers a massive seven hundred and twenty-five acres. This arbore
            tum
            contains over two hundred different spe cies of trees, making Behrend the largest
            col
            lege or university arboretum in the region. In this broad variety of species, all
            of the
            fifty state trees are included Pennsylvania’s being the eastern hemlock, or to those
            scientists, the Tsuga Canadensis.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The Penn State Behrend Arboretum has three main aspects. The first is the educational
            ap
            proach to the arboretum. The arboretum serves not only the student body and faculty,
            but
            the community as well. It acts as an educational tool on how to help preserve the
            environment. Second is the experimental aspect of the ar boretum. It serves the students
            of Behrend with the ability to experiment and test the uses, if any, of the trees
            and
            shrubs native and ex otic to our region.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Dr. Thomas I. Wortman, the assistant for aca demic
            administration and executive director of the arboretum at Penn State Behrend, said,
            “We
            would obviously like to grow,” Wortman said. “We would like to host schools as well
            as
            dif ferent groups from around the region. We would like to educate them on the different
            variety of species of trees and allow them to enjoy the beauty that the arboretum
            at
            Behrend has to offer. We have a partnership with the Lake Erie Arboretum at
            Frontier Park and are actually connected to them by the walkway that goes
            along the bayfront connector.”</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Wortman said, “We would like to concen trate more on the educational and
            research as pects that the arboretum gives.”</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Students from Behrend also appreciate this intriguing landscape. Freshman Ben
            Morris said, “The arboretum at Behrend makes the campus more scenic. I also
            think other stu dents enjoy it as well. I see people sitting along the walkways drawing
            pictures of the scenery this campus has to offer.”</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Brian Misterovich, INT B 07, said, “The ar- boretum creates a more
            interesting landscape and exposes the student body to a greater awareness to the dynamic
            tree species.” If you are interested in celebrating this achievement, there will be
            a
            tree planting cer emony to commemorate this one year anniver sary of the arboretum.
            It
            will be held Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. on the walkway just north of the Lilley Library.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">If you are interested in seeing this amazing arboretum for yourself, pick up a pamphlet
            at the information desk in the Reed Union Build ing. The pamphlet includes a brief
            history of the arboretum and a numbered map of tree names and where these trees are
            located on campus. You will be able to see over 70 dif ferent species of trees along
            with a sign below them which gives you their scientific name and any other interesting
            facts relevant to that par ticular tree.</div>

         <div class="artAuthor">Author: Amanda Charney</div>
         
         
         <div class="paras">Few students realize the amount of land Behrend claims as its own or the num ber of
            species of trees on campus or even that Behrend is now a recognized arbore tum. Even
            less is the number of students aware of what an arboretum is exactly. It was not until
            recently, April 23, 2003, that the college was recognized for its extensive collection
            of greenery.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Behrend officially carries the title of an arboretum. An arboretum typically refers
            to a
            place where an extensive variety of woody plants are cultivated for scientific,
            educational and ornamental purposes.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">With 725 total acres, Behrend is home to more than 175 different categories of trees.
            Part of this can be attributed to the significant contribution of land to the col
            lege
            from Mary Behrend.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">"I knew there were a lot of trees," said Ruth Hoetzl, BIOL 06. "I just
            never real ized that we had so many different kinds of trees on campus; without them
            we
            would die!"</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The fact that Behrend is now considered an arboretum can be attributed to one professor
            emeritus of biology, Dr. Edwin Masteller. Masteller
            worked for many years so that Behrend would become a place to admire and learn about
            different plant life. After the dedication, faculty of the Biology Department
            gathered to create a website that would guide students and the public to learning
            about
            the trees on campus</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The website, which can be accessed at http://bio.bd.psu.edu/plant_web/, includes a
            Virtual Tree Tour, labeled plants arranged in alphabetical order of com mon names
            (also
            with thumbnail image preview), a list of the trees organized by plant family and a
            collection of plant photographs from all over campus.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">The tour is a replication of a campus map with numbers indicating where certain tree
            species can be located around the university. The numbers on the map are each linked
            to
            their own web page about that particular tree.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Each tree's web page includes photographs of the whole tree, the leaves, flow ers
            (if
            existing) and the little black identification signs (again, if existing), as well
            as a
            description of the tree and links to obtain more information.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">This website is far from complete, however, as there are currently 67 trees pre sented
            on
            the virtual tour and over 175 varieties of tree on campus. Nonetheless, additions
            to the
            website will continue as Behrend's Arboretum con tinues to grow.</div>
         
         <div class="paras">Plans for the future include an herbarium or a collection of dried plants mount ed,
            labeled and systematically arranged for use in scientific study that will enhance
            education, outreach, research and conservation efforts on university property. </div>

         <div class="artAuthor">Author: Jessica Samol</div>
         
         
         
         <div class="paras">Penn State Behrend's campus is ecologically committed to protecting and conserving
            the environment. In 2001, The Greener Behrend Task Force formed to
            address sustainability issues on campus. The purpose of the Greener Behrend
            Task Force is to promote a campus community at Behrend that is educated and
            involved in maintaining a responsible relationship with the natural resources of
            the earth.</div>
         
         
         <div class="paras">Members of the Greener Behrend Task Force are committed to building respect
            for the environment and are developing and implementing strategies for campus
            practice and policies. In addition, the task force is addressing seven main issues
            at Behrend, which include reducing energy use and promoting cleaner fuels, using
            water in a conservative and respectable manner, minimizing solid and liquid
            waste, increasing the healthfulness of food and reducing its waste, protecting natural
            areas, incorporating "green" practices into the construction and renovation of
            facilities, and promoting ecological stewardship within the college community.</div>
         
         
         <div class="paras">The Greener Behrend Task Force is making great efforttoward creating a more
            environmentally friendly and sustainable environment. In 2003, the creation of
            the Arboretum at Behrend brought a much greener scene to the campus. More
            than 200 species oftrees are represented in the Arboretum, making it a haven by 
            local environmentalists for its interesting trees. Senior Associate Dean, Dr. Robert
            Light said, "The faculty and staff have further developedthe Arboretum at Penn State
            Behrend which works with the ground crew to make the campus a place recognized
            for its education, research, and outreach related to its trees and plantings." In
            addition, Light said, "The faculty and staff have established a Landscape Committee that
            works with the grounds crew to beautify specific sites on campus".</div>
         
         
         <div class="paras">The task force has also been successful in incorporating the use of geothermal
            heating in residence halls and reclaiming heat from the Junker Center pool area to
            use
            in other parts of the building. In addition, automatic heating and cooling setbacks
            are
            being utilized when buildings are not in use, and automatic light shutoff has been
            installed in classrooms and parking lots when they are not in use. Among other
            promising efforts to reduce energy use, Light said, "They are working with housing
            to promote the installation of"low-flow" showerheads in residence halls, and working
            
            with housekeeping to maintain the college's activerecycling program."</div>
         
         
         <div class="paras">Educating the Behrend community about sustainability is a vital asset to create a
            more knowledgeable and environmentally friendly campus. "We need the faculty,
            staff, and students to realize how important becoming sustainable is, not only on
            campus, but in general. The entire community must drive sustainability efforts and
            not wait or rely on a few to push the program," Light said.</div>
         
         
         <div class="paras">The Greener Behrend Task Force is integrating sustainability topics into the curricular offerings throughout the
            college as part of their education campaign. The
            community can become more involved in creating a more sustainable environment
            by "Learningmore about sustainable issues and working with college leaders to promote
            environmentally friendly ideas," Light said. With future plans for the task
            force, Behrend will continue to stand as a role model for other institutions by promoting
            a greener environment.</div>
